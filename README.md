# Web Crawler
## Description
A web crawler with scraping techniques, focused on extracting the first 30 entries from a website. In this example I used this [site](https://news.ycombinator.com).
Also, the software can perform this two actions:
- Filter all previous entries with more than five words in the title ordered by the number of comments first.
- Filter all previous entries with less than or equal to five words in the title ordered by points.
## Technologies
For this project I used:
- Java 17.
- JUnit for testing.
- JSoup for HTML manipulation.
Note: This project was made using NetBeans 20.
